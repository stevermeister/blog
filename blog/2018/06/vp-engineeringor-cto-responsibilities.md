# VP Engineering(or CTO) responsibilities


Once upon a time, CPO asked me what my current activities are and I did not have an exact answer. It was so unusual for me because I really like to structure everything and know all the detailed answers. On a position of a technical coordinator / VP Engineering (or you can call it CTO), I have so many different types of activities that are difficult to structure.


Let’s try to group them (an important remark: these activities are what I’m doing, but I’m not saying that it’s a MUST for CTO ):

## Technical vision

* Develop a technical strategy for the company
  * platform selection and technical design
  * specifying tools
  * project architecture, code structure, the data structure
* High-level technical overview
* Performance analysis
* Security audit
* Reduce costs

## Recruitment & Brand development

* looking for smart people in the network
* interview process
* building a school of own trainees
* communication with external recruitment agencies
* organizing/support conferences/meetups
* organizing different team building activities

## Knowledge sharing & Self-education

* Identify and exploit new technologies
* grow technical leaders
* track progress
* build individual Development Plan
* project-application knowledge sharing
* reevaluation procedure

## Process

* setup agile process, make adjustments if needed
* assure department/team is self-sufficient in terms of resources
* participate in company roadmap planning
