If you work with **AngularJS** a lot you probably know that when you want to use **cookies** with all the options like domain, path, etc... you face with lack of functionality in native **Angular [ngCookies](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngCookies)** module. It's almost 3 years when [this issue](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/950 "More powerful $cookies service") has been reported.

So I've created my module - **[ng-biscuit](https://stevermeister.github.io/ng-biscuit/ "github.io/ng-biscuit/")** to deal with cookie options.

There is also alternative by [Dmitri Voronianski](https://github.com/voronianski "github.com/voronianski") by name [ngKookies](https://github.com/voronianski/ngKookies "github.com") which is port of [jquery-cookie](https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie).
