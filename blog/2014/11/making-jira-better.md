Our team found that it was not so convenient to have avatars for assigned developers only for **Plan** mode and not for **Work** (**Rapid** board of **Jira Agile**).

I'd create a [question](https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/9877397/jiraagile-assigned-users-avatars-for-user-stories-not-only-for-tasks "Unwatch Share [Jira][Agile] assigned users Avatars for User Stories (not only for tasks)") about that issue on **Atlassian Answers**, but unfortunately the answer was "_Unfortunately this is not possible due to the way User Stories are displayed in the system._"

I had a thought "why not to tweak it with userscript?" and solution came after:

**[jira-agile-avatars.user.js](https://github.com/stevermeister/jira-userscripts/blob/master/jira-agile-avatars.user.js "github.com")**

You are welcome with criticism and suggestions.
