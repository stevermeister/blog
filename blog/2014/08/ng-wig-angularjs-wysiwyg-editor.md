I was looking for light-weight solution base on **AngularJS** to extend **textarea** with only basic functionality (like headings, text-weight, lists) and found nothing really close to initial requirements, so I've spent some time and invented my own wheel - **[ng-wig editor](https://stevermeister.github.io/ngWig/)**,Â welcome for telling criticism and [propositions](https://github.com/stevermeister/ngWig/issues).
